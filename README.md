Deep Learning for Cervical Cancer Diagnosis: Multimodal approach

Abstract

Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancer typesworldwide  and  has  an  elevated  mortality  rate.This  ismainly due to the asymptomatic feature that is related withthe first stages of the disease.  Therefore it is extremely im-portant to perform early diagnosis and effective screeningin  order  to  detect  the  problem  in  its  initial  stages.   Sev-eral developed countries have already implemented screen-ing programmes however the process is extensive composedby  HPV  test,  cytology  test  (or  Pap  smear),  colposcopy,and  biopsy.   Therefore  tools  to  facilitate  the  process  mayhighly benefit both the effectiveness and time saving aspectof any phase.  In this paper it is suggested a deep learningapproach  to  classify  the  risk  of  cancer  by  analyzing  col-poscopy images using two datasets with different labels butsimilar cervigram images.  The Neural Model constructedfeatures Multimodal and Multitask learning making use ofthe two different datasets in two different classification taskswith a shared section that learns information from both. Thebest model was able to achieve 92.97% AUC, 94.92% sen-sitivity and 83.12% specificity using ResNet architecture.
